This is a note taking app created using Vite (TypeScript) and could expand into full stack app in the future. Currently, the app was designed to help users take notes during meetings and refer to previous notes as well 

Inspiration came from using the app Obsidian 

Tech stack used in this app: 

Typescript
Material UI for the UI components 

backend -> TBH (leaning towards springboot )

More to come as the project gets built out!
